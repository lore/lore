   * Change what gets returned from the Redux store.
   *
   * This method is intended ONLY as a way to explore different solutions for addressing
   * immutability concerns that arise when components have a direct reference to
   * the data kept in the reducers.
   *
   * The default behavior in Redux is to provide components with a reference to the
   * store state returned from the reducers. This poses a problem when a component
   * tries to change that data, because it will modify the state of the store through
   * that reference.
   *
   * To address this issue, the top-level reducer will invoke this method right before
   * returning the next state, which gives you the ability to experiment with different
   * solutions for this problem.
   *
   * The default behavior is to return a copy of the store state, which will prevent any
   * component from being able to modify the "truth" kept in the reducers.
   *
   * Others solutions could be invoking `Object.freeze(nextState)` (which will throw an
   * error if a component tries to modify the store state) or converting the store state
   * to an Immutable object using `Immutable.map(nextState)` from Immutable.js.
