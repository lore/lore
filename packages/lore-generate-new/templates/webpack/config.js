/**
 * This file is the default webpack config. You can override it on a per environment basis by specifying
 * environment specific files in /env.
 *
 * The intent with this file is to:
 *
 * 1. Have a build process that works out of the box so you don't have to learn Webpack until you want/need to.
 * 2. Have it include all the common loaders, so you don't have to figure out how to add things like jsx, css and images
 * into your project.
 * 3. Alias `react`, so you don't hit any issues with duplicate copies of React due to npm packages that aren't using a
 * peerDependency for React.
 * 4. Declare the application root as the **__LORE_ROOT__** variable, so that Lore knows where your project is in the
 * file system and can require all necessary files at build time.
