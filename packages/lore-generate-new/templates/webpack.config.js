/**
 * This file builds and exports the final webpack config using the default
 * configuration in `/webpack/config.js` plus any environment specific
 * overrides that should be applied on top of it.
 *
 * This file also needs to specify the application root and pass it to the
 * webpack configs in `/webpack`, so `/webpack/config.js` can define the
 * `__LORE_ROOT__` constant (which the Lore framework uses to build file paths
 * to project folders like /models, /actions, /reducers, etc.
 *
 * Because webpack bundles the project into a single file under
 * `/dist/bundle.js`, it needs to know at *build* time what files it needs to
 * include.  So while dynamic require statements will work in a Node app
 * (because `require()` is a synchronous operation, that approach won't work
 * with Webpack. All file paths need to be explicit during build time.  The
 * alternative was to use relative paths to back out of the `lore` package in
 * `node_modules` and into the project itself, but that seemed like a worse
 * and somewhat fragile alternative.
