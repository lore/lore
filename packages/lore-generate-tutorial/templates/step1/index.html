<!--This is the HTML file that gets served to the browser.  It contains text-->
<!--that says "Loading..." that will disappear as soon as `bundle.js` has been-->
<!--downloaded and `lore.summon()` has finished setting up your application.-->

<!--It also contains a DOM element to hang dialogs from so they don't conflict-->
<!--with any CSS or JavaScript behaviors in the application (styling overrides-->
<!--or event bubbling cancellation).-->
