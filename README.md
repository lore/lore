Convention driven framework for React + Redux applications.

>"We called it `lore` because `opinions!` was already taken."

TODO:
Finish the README!  Talk about how to install, link to docs, thanks people! (React, Redux, React-Router, Sails).

Need to mention the project adhers to semantic versioning...link to examples...

Can we add a gist? If one exists, it's probably just pointing out the boilerplate we've consumed in conventions, or
possibly a very condensed version of the motivation/opinions driving this framework.

Maybe just point straight to the docs?
